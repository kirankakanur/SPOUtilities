# SPOUtilities

In the spirit of "Sharing is caring" .... Thanks to Vesa Juvonen and the Office Dev PnP Team for the amazing things that you do for the SharePoint/Office 365 community.

This is a Console App (based on .NET Framework). It contains references to the latest SharePoint Online CSOM package.  As of now, it provides the following utilities for managing your SharePoint Online site.

I will be adding more utilities, and will share them.


- Enable Major and Minor Versions in Document Library. This enables 5 major versions, and retains drafts for 2 major versions.
- Delete Old Document Versions in "Documents" library. This deletes "older" versions (i.e. greater than 15) documents in the library.
- Get Last Modified Information from all Sites and "Document" Library in a Site Collection. This recurses through all Webs.
